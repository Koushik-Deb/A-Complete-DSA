In Union Find Algorithm, the algo must be 

1. Reflexive - p is connected to p
2. Symmetric - If p is connected to q, q is connected to p.
3. Transitive - If p is connected to q and q is connected to r, then p is connected to r.

Connected Components - Maximal set of objects that are mutually connected.
